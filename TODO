# angular

  * research what is the best way to link pages => / or #
  * figure out why there is an infinite redirection for / and otherwise
  * figure out how to render public page such as register/login without #
  * implement logout feature/logic
  * use ngCookies to store local session or localStorage for multiple tabs
  * implement user access roles -> maybe it is better to avoid administration responsibilities to leak into this project though

# HTML

  * add a fluid layout framework... bootstrap, foundation, I don't think top-coat does grid layout for you

# assets

  * favicon
