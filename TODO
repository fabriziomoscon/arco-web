# angular

  * find the best way to link pages => / or #
  * figure out why there is an infinite redirection for / and otherwise

  * figure out how to render public page such as register/login without #
  * implement logout feature
  * use ngCookies to store local session or localStorage for multiple tabs
  * implemnt user access roles -> maybe it is better to leave the admin on another website to keep responsibilities isolated

# HTML

  * add a fluid layout framework... bootstrap, foundation, I don't think top-coat does grid layout for you

# assets

  * favicon
